# test.application.properties - this is used by the junit test and integration-test
# it overrides properties values from main application.propertes
# you only need to put properties in here if they are only used by the tests classes
# themselves or if you need to override any particular properties from 
# main application.properties

# THE UNIT TESTS COMBINE application.properties AND THIS PROPERTIES FILE...
# YOU ONLY NEED TO PUT PROPERTIES IN HERE IF THEY ARE USED BY A UNIT TEST FRAMEWORK LIKE
# MOCKSERVER OR IF YOU NEED TO OVERRIDE AN EXISTING PROPERTY VALUE THAT IS ALREADY
# IN application.properties FOR UNIT TEST.

# these props are used by some unit/integration tests
